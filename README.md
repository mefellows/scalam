ScalAM
======

An opinionated micro-framework for Scala, using Scalatra, Angular, Akka and MongoDB

##Give me the skinny - why another framework?
OK, so I wanted a nimble, small and reactive framework for building real-time Web Apps. Rails and Play are both great but both come with baggage I can't fit in my boot (trunk). Skinny Framework is also quite promising, although it is moving in th Rails direction and is unopinionated - which is what I'd like to avoid.

##What's in a name?
It could just have easily been named Scal.I.AM, but that would be torture for anyone trying to find / refer to it in written form. Scaliam might work. Scalaam etc. Meh, for now its Scalam.
