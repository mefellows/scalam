ScalAM
======
**NOTE: Currently this is pre-alpha stuff, so don't waste your time here if you're looking for something to use in Production**

An opinionated framework for Scala, using Scalatra, Angular, Akka and MongoDB, built on top of the Respite REST micro-framework.

##Getting started
Make sure you have 2 choices: 

1. Clone this repo and manually modify everything to your liking: ```git clone https://github.com/mefellows/scalam.git```
2. Use the [Scalam](https://github.com/mefellows/scalam-generator) Yeoman Generator and do it the easy way

##Give me the skinny - why another framework?
OK, so I wanted a nimble, small and reactive framework for building real-time Web Apps. Rails and Play are both great but both come with baggage I can't fit in my boot (trunk). Skinny Framework is also quite promising, although it is moving in th Rails direction and is unopinionated - which is what I'd like to avoid.

##What's in a name?
It could just have easily been named Scal.I.AM, but that would be torture for anyone trying to find / refer to it in written form. Scaliam might work. Scalaam etc. Meh, for now its Scalam.

##License
